# **Rocco's Tales: Text-to-Video Automation**

## **Overview**

**Rocco's Tales** is a project dedicated to transforming various forms of text-based content—such as stories, novels, books, Reddit posts, comics, and mangas—into engaging videos using advanced AI technologies. The project automates the extraction, analysis, and generation of multimedia elements, ensuring each video is visually and audibly appealing while staying true to the original content.

## **Project Goals**

- Convert text-based content into high-quality, immersive videos.
- Automate character and location extraction from text.
- Generate AI-driven voices for narration and character dialogue.
- Create dynamic backgrounds and adaptive soundscapes.
- Implement advanced scene composition and narrative pacing.
- Produce polished videos that seamlessly integrate audio, visual, and textual elements.

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Character and Emotion Dynamics**
   - **Emotion Detection**: Implement AI that detects and interprets the emotions expressed by characters in the text, allowing for nuanced voice modulation and facial expressions in generated images.
   - **Character Interaction**: Enhance realism by focusing on how characters interact with each other, adjusting positions and body language based on relationships and scene context.

### 2. **Advanced Scene Composition**
   - **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Generate backgrounds that subtly change to reflect the mood of the scene, with elements like lighting shifts, weather changes, and atmospheric effects.
   - **Cinematic Techniques**: Incorporate cinematic techniques like zooms, pans, and cuts to create engaging visuals, moving beyond static image sequences.

### 3. **Adaptive Soundscapes**
   - **Adaptive Sound Effects**: Design soundscapes that adapt to the actions and settings described in the text, with ambient sounds that change based on location and environment.
   - **Music Scoring**: Add AI-generated background music that matches the tone and pace of the narrative, dynamically adjusting based on scene intensity and emotional content.

### 4. **Narrative Pacing**
   - **Variable Pacing**: Adjust narration speed and image transitions depending on the scene, with slower pacing for introspective moments and faster pacing for action sequences.
   - **Interactive Narration**: Offer options for user interaction, allowing them to choose different narrative paths or focus on specific characters.

### 5. **AI-Driven Voice Narration and Sound Effects**
   - **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Develop AI-generated voices for narration, ensuring the tone and style match the content.
   - **Character Voices**: Assign unique AI-generated voices to each character, reflecting their distinct personalities.
   - **Sound Effects**: Automatically generate and synchronize sound effects with the narrative.

### 6. **Image Creation**
   - **Character Visualization**: Create AI-generated images of characters in multiple positions and expressions, based on extracted descriptions.
   - **Location Visualization**: Develop AI-generated images for each location, reflecting the described atmosphere and setting.
   - **Scene Illustration**: Generate a corresponding AI image for every scene, combining characters and locations to create a cohesive visual narrative.

### 7. **Video Creation**
   - **Scene Assembly**: Combine AI-generated images and voices to create a video for each scene.
   - **Narrative Flow**: Ensure smooth transitions between scenes, maintaining the narrative flow and emotional impact of the original text.
   - **Final Production**: Integrate all elements—audio narration, character dialogues, sound effects, and scene visuals—into a polished video.

## **Setup and Installation**

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- Access to AI models for text analysis, image generation, and voice synthesis

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IvanWeissVanDerPol/Rocco-s-Tales.git
   cd Rocco-s-Tales
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup AI Models**
   - Follow the instructions in `models/README.md` to set up the necessary AI models for text analysis, image generation, and voice synthesis.

## **Usage**

1. **Input Text**
   - Add the text content you want to convert into a video in the `input/` directory.
   - The text can be in various formats, including `.txt`, `.docx`, or `.pdf`.

2. **Run the Script**
   - Execute the main script to start the process of text-to-video conversion.
   ```bash
   python main.py --input input/your-file.txt --output output/
   ```

3. **Output Video**
   - The generated video will be saved in the `output/` directory, with separate subdirectories for images, audio, and final video files.
